# Etch-a-Sketch

This was a project to learn to build sketchpad style web app with the following functionality:
 - resizable grid
 - grid is painted using mouseover
 - black, white, rainbow, random, and custom pen colors
 - erase button

 I ended up adding a background color selection feature.

 If I return to this project, I plan to add a shading feature that allows the user to have some control over the opacity of the color. In addition, I am considering adding functionality to only draw on mouseover when the left mouse button is down for finer control.

 One thing that is clear to me after working on this project is that I really need to learn about objects in JavaScript. This would be much easier and cleaner to code with a mix of functions and objects.
